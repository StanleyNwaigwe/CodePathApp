App Idea: SleepSing – Alarm Manager with Spotify Integration

Description:
SleepSync is an app designed to help users wake up to their favorite music by integrating alarm management with Spotify playlists. It allows users to set custom alarms that are linked to specific Spotify playlists. When the alarm goes off, instead of a typical ringtone, a user’s chosen playlist plays, making waking up a more enjoyable experience. The app also offers features for managing multiple alarms, customizing alarm times, and organizing playlists for different occasions, such as morning, workout, or relaxation sessions.
